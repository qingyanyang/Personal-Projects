# Personal-Projects
have done some personal projects in my spare time

1. javaSwing: follow the tutorial, I wrote this snake game~
2. Artaste & RSP: learn web front end developing and wrote these two interfaces by using origin HTML, CSS and some JS(not too much);
3. management system web: this is a full stack project, I think this can be treated as my real personal project, I have learned React, node.js, express, JavaScript ES6, Mongodb, Ajax, promise, axios, antd to implement this management system web! but I am still not very familar with them, only know how to use them (need to reveiw notes when using it probably). But anyway I made this out as my first personal project.
