I am attending a bootcamp program in the summer holiday, and I am building a website for it as my personal project. 

It's just static homepage currently, I analysed the function requirements and their logic distributions, and then designed the layout by photoshop, 
after then, I used HTML and CSS to make the layout be static website, and I also added some interactive effect and functions by JavaScript.

I will work on build the whole web in the next few weeks.
